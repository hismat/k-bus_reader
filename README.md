# k-bus_reader
Small program for Arduino Nano Every to read BMW K-BUS data

## Required items
No K-Bus specific IC needed. Just Arduino Nano Every board and some common electronic components are necessary.
- Arduino Nano Every
- USB cable to connect PC to the Arduino board
- Resistance and diode for converting voltage level from 12V to 5V

## Setup
Below is just an example to get K-Bus signal input to Arduino Rx pin while dropping voltage to 5V.
